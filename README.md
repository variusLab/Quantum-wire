# From Fabry-Perot oscillations to Coulomb blockade in a quantum wire

Master 2 computer project, Centre de Physique Th√©orique, Aix-Marseille University

The aim of the project is to take the solutions of Dyson equation for the retarded Green function of the one-dimensional quantum wire with two impurities (obtained in [ZGBC-2014](https://hal.science/hal-01257951/document))
and to draw, using Mathematica, its density of states (DOS) as a function of position on the wire and its energy. The provided code allows one to explore how the interaction and impurity potential strength modifies the DOS profile.
